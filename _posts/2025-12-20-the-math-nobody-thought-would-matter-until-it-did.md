# From Reddit to Rigor

Recently I was chilling in one of our university club Discord servers when someone dropped a screenshot of a Reddit rant:  
pure math is useless, nobody needs it, waste of time, the usual stuff.

And to be fair, there’s some truth in that. Pure math really _is_ useless at first. Every subfield started as a way to chase a proof, or reach that mathematical climax just for the sake of it. There were no applications waiting for it, no industry ready to adopt it, no practical payoff that anyone could see. At the time, these discoveries existed in a bubble of abstraction, appreciated only by those who were willing to follow their curiosity to its limits.

However, that seeming uselessness is deceptive. Every one of those “useless” fields just needed time. Slowly but surely, problems arose that perfectly matched the patterns those mathematicians had uncovered. And before long, the same people who mocked the theory ended up depending on it, often without even realizing it. What looked impractical became indispensable.

And this is exactly what we'll be discovering in this blog post, so strap up, grab a cup of your favourite drink, and enjoy.

# Number Theory (The Quest for Hidden Patterns, 18th–19th Century)

Long before number theory was useful, it used to look a lot like those Facebook posts you stumble upon on a Friday, from which you try to deduce the next number of a sequence, But think about it for a moment. What actually makes you eager to find the next number?

It’s not usefulness. It’s the satisfaction of uncovering that devious hidden pattern.
That exact instinct is what drove number theory for centuries. Mathematicians weren’t trying to build machines or optimize systems. They were chasing patterns hidden inside the integers, simply because they were there.

Euclid studied divisibility and primes in ancient Greece. Fermat filled the margins of his books with claims he never proved. Euler and Gauss systematized entire worlds of arithmetic, although all of them were fully aware that none of it solved any practical problem.
And then nothing happened.  
For centuries.

Then, after a long time, humans faced difficulties that no one had imagined before: how to communicate securely over distances and how to keep sensitive information safe.
Suddenly, the ideas that number theorists had pursued for curiosity alone, primes, modular arithmetic, factorization, became exactly what was needed. What once lived only in notebooks now became the foundation of modern cryptography and digital security.

Number theory didn’t become useful because anyone planned it. Its patterns and structures only revealed their power when mathematicians began asking deeper questions about the underlying order of mathematics itself, questions that would eventually lead to the abstract world of group theory.

# Group Theory (The Math of Hidden Symmetry, 19th Century)

Mathematicians in the 19th century often played with patterns just for the fun of it. Imagine arranging objects in every possible way, noticing symmetries and transformations, and trying to understand the rules that link them, not to solve a particular problem, not to build something big, just to see that special hidden order.

Évariste Galois, barely out of his teens, obsessed over the solutions to polynomial equations, uncovering patterns that anyone could barely predict. Cauchy and Cayley formalized the idea of a “group,” an abstract structure capturing symmetry itself. They were not trying to create useful tools or applications, they were exploring patterns for the sheer intellectual thrill, chasing that climax that exists purely in the world of ideas.

For decades, these ideas lived only in journals and notebooks, admired by a small circle of mathematicians who recognized their elegance but had no idea what practical role they might play. Galois had invented group theory solely to determine when polynomial equations could be solved by radicals ( i.e, using **only basic arithmetic operations**, or in simple terms, the roots admit a general formula) , a question that, while intellectually deep, had no immediate application outside mathematics. The notion of a “group” seemed like a game played entirely in the mind, a private dance of numbers and transformations. No industry adopted it and no engineer found immediate use for it.

Then, much later, the world began asking questions that demanded exactly the kind of thinking Galois and Cayley had explored. Scientists needed to understand the symmetries of molecules and crystals, physicists required a language for particle behavior, and mathematicians found applications in combinatorics, coding theory, and even puzzles like rubik's cube that hid patterns in plain sight.

Suddenly, the abstract groups that once existed only for intellectual thrill became indispensable tools. What had been a purely theoretical game now shaped the way we understand the natural world, solve complex problems, and even encrypt information.

Group theory didn’t become useful because anyone anticipated it. For decades, it existed as a purely abstract exploration of symmetry, admired by a small circle of mathematicians. Its structures only proved essential when new questions about the nature of mathematics itself began to emerge, laying the groundwork for explorations that would go far beyond numbers and patterns.

# Set Theory (the Foundations of Mathematics, Late 19th- Early 20th Century)

After the adventures of number theory and the symmetries of group theory, mathematicians began asking deeper questions: what _is_ a number? What is a function, a collection, or even infinity itself? They wanted to build a solid foundation for all of mathematics, a rigorous framework that left no doubts.

Georg Cantor, with his daring exploration of infinity, stunned the mathematical world. He showed that some infinities are larger than others, a concept that was almost unimaginable at the time  (I would pay anything to be in that time). Richard Dedekind formalized numbers in ways that made them logically airtight. Ernst Zermelo, together with Abraham Fraenkel, developed axioms for sets to prevent paradoxes that had once thrown mathematicians into confusion.

For years, these concepts remained purely theoretical. Infinity, continuity, and the very notion of “sets” seemed like playgrounds for logic and imagination, far from any practicality. Yet the world would eventually need them. The rigorous foundations Cantor, Dedekind, Zermelo, and Fraenkel developed became the bedrock for computer science, formal logic, and algorithms. The way computers handle numbers, functions, and data today rests on the abstract scaffolding those bright minds built.

Set theory didn’t prove its worth immediately. For decades, it remained a playground for logic and imagination. Yet its frameworks became essential when mathematicians needed absolute clarity, laying the groundwork for new questions about **space, shape, and continuity**, the seeds of topology.
# Topology (The Mathematics of Shape and Continuity, 20th Century)

With the foundations of mathematics firmly in place, mathematicians began to ask questions not just about numbers or abstract structures, but about **space itself**. What does it mean for a shape to be “connected”? How can one distinguish surfaces that can be stretched or deformed from those that cannot? How do you classify spaces without relying on rigid measurements?

Topology arose from these questions. Mathematicians like Henri Poincaré and Felix Hausdorff explored the properties of spaces that remain unchanged under continuous deformations, stretching, bending, or twisting, but never tearing. Unlike geometry, which measures lengths and angles, topology focused on **qualitative properties**, the essence of shapes and their connectivity.

For many years, topology appeared to be a realm for abstract thinking, distanced from any real-world applications. Mathematicians explored spaces, surfaces, and shapes for the excitement of grasping what fundamentally links them, twists them, or forms loops. Nevertheless, as time passed, these abstract concepts unveiled their concealed strength: they assisted physicists in understanding material behaviour, directed computer scientists through intricate networks, and even clarified the enigmatic folding of proteins and the architecture of DNA. What was previously confined to the minds of mathematicians transformed into a perspective that allowed for the comprehension of the real world.

Topology became valuable not because anyone anticipated it. Its brilliance surfaced organically when global inquiries encountered concepts that had been nurtured for the sheer pleasure of exploration. At that moment, the abstract proved essential, and the quest for pure mathematics uncovered its greatest treasure: the power to influence our perception, comprehension, and engagement with reality itself

# Epilogue: The Journey Complete

From curious scribbles in ancient margins to the abstract playgrounds of modern mathematics, we’ve seen how pure math grew not from necessity, but from the human drive to explore, to question, and to uncover hidden patterns.

Number theory whispered secrets in primes and modular arithmetic. Group theory danced through hidden symmetries, twisting objects and patterns in ways only the intrigued mind could see. Set theory carved the invisible framework of mathematics, giving structure to infinity and the abstract. And topology revealed the essence of shape and connectivity. Each field began as a pursuit for curiosity alone, yet together they formed a tapestry that underpins the world we live in.

Pure math didn’t become useful because anyone demanded it. It became indispensable because the world eventually needed the questions mathematicians had already dared to ask. What seemed abstract, playful, or “useless” transformed into the language through which we understand security, symmetry, computation, and space itself.

So next time someone says “pure math is useless,” remember: what begins as a question for curiosity’s sake can, in time, shape the very fabric of reality. The pursuit of knowledge, for its own sake, is never wasted, it is the seed from which all discovery grows.
