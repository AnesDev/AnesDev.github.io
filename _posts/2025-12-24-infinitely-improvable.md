# An Axiom I Never Questioned

Back when I was a kid, I've always been told by teachers "Anes, you still can improve your essay" no matter how good it was, there was always "room for improvement". For years, I accepted that like an axiom. However recently in a bus ride home, or as I like to call it, my "deep time", I rewound my mind to those moments from my childhood and let my thoughts run free to follow that idea that I was always forced to believe and see where it leads.

# Reasoning

Before we begin the proof, we specify the goal. Let it be maximising the readability and the comprehension of the essay's reader.

Now that it's out of the way, let's set our initial premises clear :

- How do we measure the comprehension, or how clear is the idea expressed in the essay to the reader?

Let $$ C_i $$ be a number that quantifies goodness of the essay corresponding to the combination of words $$ i $$, where $$ i \in \mathbb{R}^+ $$ such that

$$
C_i = f(\text{correctness}_i, \text{clarity}_i, \text{coherence}_i, \text{style}_i, \ldots)
$$

Now let $$ S $$ be the set of all possible values of $$ C_i $$, thus $$ S=\{C_1, C_2,\ldots, C_n\} $$

If we literally interpret the words of the teachers, then the formalisation of the goal is basically finding $$ \max(S) $$. However looking for the absolute maximum of $$ S $$ is **absurd!**

Why?

One could argue that $$ S $$ is bounded. A middle or high school student knows only a handful portion of the language's vocabulary, and even if we consider the entire language, the number of available words remains finite. For a bounded essay length, the number of possible combinations is therefore finite, and so a maximum of $$ S $$ does exist.

# Limits of Perfection

Yet the problem is not the _existence_ of $$ \max(S) $$, but its _relevance_. Near the top of $$ S $$, differences between values of $$ C_i $$ correspond to marginal stylistic variations, subjective preferences, or diminishing gains in clarity. Optimizing beyond this point no longer improves comprehension in any meaningful sense, it just makes it more **enjoyable** to read rather than more informative.

Now let $$ A $$ be set of all acceptable values of $$ C_i $$, therefore

$$
A = \{ C_i \in S \mid C_i \ge C_{\text{threshold}} \}
$$

So any essay that lies in $$ A $$ succeeds sufficiently in its goal of communication. But notice the words I just used, "**sufficiently**". Thus, the statement of the teacher "there is still room for improvement" becomes ambiguous. Because while technically true, one may always move closer to $$ \max(S) $$, however for a student who is not being trained in stylistic writing or poetry, such refinements lie outside the stated objective of the task and silently shifts the goal from clear communication to the pursuit of an abstract optimum, a target that is neither defined nor pedagogically relevant.

The problem is not just formal or theoretical, it's psychological. A student constantly told "you can still improve" when their work already lies in $$ A $$ may internalize a sense of insufficiency. Instead of focusing on meaningful learning, grasping concepts, experimenting with ideas, or maybe improving other weak spots in other subjects, they end up chasing refinements that have almost zero **return on investment**. Every marginal tweak in style or word choice takes time and cognitive energy, but contributes little to none actual communication or understanding.

# Sufficient and Significant

Recognizing this allows a shift in perspective. Looking back from my "deep time" on the bus, I can see that much of my dislike to writing in my childhood stemmed from chasing abstract perfection rather than understanding. Improvements should still exists but it in a **guided, purposeful, and meaningful** way. Perhaps teachers could achieve more by celebrating when an essay is already within $$ A $$, encouraging students to **invest effort where the return is real**, and planting in them curiosity rather than perfectionism.

For all of you folks who have ever stared at an essay, convinced it was already good enough, only to hear "you can still improve," I hope this gave you some perspective. It's not about settling or stopping effort, it's about **investing energy where it actually matters**, focusing on understanding, clarity, and meaningful growth, rather than chasing a perfection that doesn't exist.
